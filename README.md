## Project Description

### Project Idea and Approach
This project explores how clustering algorithms, specifically k-means, can be used to group students based on their performance metrics. The aim is to identify at-risk students by categorizing them into groups such as "high-performing," "average," and "at-risk." This classification helps educators to provide timely interventions and support where needed. The project uses a dataset with various student performance metrics and builds a model to perform clustering. An interactive dashboard is included to visualize these clusters and their correlations.

### Tech Stack Used
- **Python**: Programming language used for the implementation.
- **Streamlit**: Framework used to develop the interactive web interface for data visualization.
- **scikit-learn**: Library used for implementing the k-means clustering algorithm.
- **pickle**: Used for saving and loading the clustering model.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and handling.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Plotly**: For interactive data visualizations.
